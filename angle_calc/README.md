Integration and modularity in the male genitalia and parameres of Belostoma species of bifoveolatum group sensu Lauck, 1962 (Insecta, Belostomatidae): submitted to Zoologischer Anzeiger

To know whether the variation explained by allometry of different parts of male genitalia and parameres comprised part or almost all variation seen along PC axes, angles between the corresponding regression vectors were computed as the arccosines of the signed inner products between the regression vectors (after standardisation of both vectors to unit length). The same was done for PLSs axes. We computed the p-values as the area of the cap divided by the area of the entire hypersphere (see Li, 2011).

It is important to use calcang.R together with vealeat.R and angu.R functions! Please fell free to modify the source addresses.
